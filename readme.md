# Model Rocketry
Some parametric/OpenSCAD assets for model rocketry.

## To-Do - Nose Cone Mk2
- [ ] Rename default cone shape to Spherical Nose Cone.
- [ ] Add parameter option to render either Cone, Shoulder, or both.
  - Useful for selecting which part of the nose cone to 3D print.
- [ ] Add parameter to each to add infill weight to the tip of the nose cone.
  - This will need to be tested using basic PLA and a scale to determine the weight of the infill.

## To-Do - Repository
- [ ] Add a license to the repository.
- [ ] Add references to source material used for each design. And properly tahnk those who's work I've referenced and used.

## Note
`Model_Rocket_Fin_Guide.scad` is not my design. I found it on Thingiverse and modified it to fit my needs. The original design can be found [here](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4292667).
